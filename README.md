<u>Exam 1:</u>

<strong>This exam contains <u>three problems</u> asking </strong><strong>multiple questions</strong><strong>. Please answer each question <u>in detail with clear explanation</u>. &#x1f642;</strong>




<strong><u>Problem 1.</u></strong>

<ol>

 <li>What is the growth of the below functions? <strong>Explain in detail and <u>show ALL the work</u></strong>.</li>

 <li>Compare the growth of <em>Test1(n)</em> and <em>Test2(n)</em>. <strong>Show all the work</strong>.</li>

 <li>Let’s say you can finish running <em>Test2(10<sup>6</sup>)</em> in <em>1</em> Could you estimate when you finish running <em>Test1(100)</em>?</li>

</ol>




<strong><u>Problem 2.</u></strong> A sorted array and a random number are given to you. Develop an algorithm to find the total number of the repetitions of the given number.

<em><u>Example 1</u></em>: <em><u>Input</u></em>: a = [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 6], key = 2         ➔ <em><u>Output</u></em>: “2 was repeated 3 times.”

<em><u>Example 2</u></em>: <em><u>Input</u></em>: a = [0, 0, 2, 2, 3, 9, 10, 12, 15], key = 10 ➔ <em><u>Output</u></em>: “10 was repeated 1 times.”

<em><u>Example 2</u></em>: <em><u>Input</u></em>: a = [0, 1,  3, 8, 12], key = 5                      ➔ <em><u>Output</u></em>: “5 was repeated 0 times.”




<ol>

 <li>How would you find the total number of repetitions for the given number? (<strong>Note</strong>: If you have multiple answers in mind, break them apart and explain each one separately.) Explain each solution/algorithm in a few lines.</li>

</ol>




<ol>

 <li>Write the pseudocode for the best algorithm you came up with.</li>

</ol>




<ol>

 <li>Implement your answer using any programming language you want to.</li>

</ol>




<ol>

 <li>What is the time complexity of your answer? <strong>Explain in detail and show all the work</strong>. (<strong>Note</strong>: If possible, break your code/pseudocode to different parts, calculate the runtime for each step and then try to calculate the total running time based on that.)</li>

</ol>

<strong> </strong>

<strong> </strong>

<strong><u>Problem 3.</u></strong> A random array of size <em>n</em> is given to you. You know that the elements in the array are nonnegative integers less than <em>n</em>. Develop an algorithm to <u>find the mode</u> (the value that appears most) <u>and the numbers repeated more than once</u>.

<em> </em>

<em><u>Example 1</u></em>: <em><u>Input</u></em>: a = [6, 0 ,1, 5, 1, 1, 4, 5], ➔ <em><u>Output1</u></em>: “1 is the mode.”

<em><u>Output2</u></em>:  “6 was repeated 2 times,

<ul>

 <li>was repeated 3 times.”</li>

</ul>

<em><u>Example 2</u></em>: <em><u>Input</u></em>: a = [0, 2, 4, 2, 2, 0, 0, 5, 4], ➔ <em><u>Output1</u></em>: “0 and 2 are the mode.”

<em><u>Output2</u></em>: “0 was repeated 3 times,

<ul>

 <li>was repeated 3 times,</li>

</ul>

4 was repeated 2 times.””

<strong> </strong>

<strong>(Hint</strong>: Remember the algorithms we learned in the class (searchings and sortings). Could you pick a good one and use parts of it to solve this question?)
